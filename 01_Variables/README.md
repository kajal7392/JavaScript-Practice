# 01 - JavaScript Variables Practice (`var`, `let`, `const`)

This folder contains all practice and mini-projects related to **JavaScript variable declarations** using `var`, `let`, and `const`. The goal is to build a solid foundation in variable behavior, scope, and real-world use cases.

---

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Declaring variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Reassignment and redeclaration rules
- Block scope vs function scope
- `const` with objects (mutation vs reassignment)
- `typeof` operator for identifying data types
- Real-world mini project using variables

---

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Declared and printed variables of different types
- Reassigned variables and understood error behavior
- Demonstrated block-level scope with `let`
- Demonstrated object property change vs reassignment with `const`
- Used a loop to show how `let` and `var` behave differently in scope
- Wrote a function to display a user profile using template literals
