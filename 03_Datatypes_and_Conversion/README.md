# 03 - Data Types, Type Conversion & Comparisons

This folder contains JavaScript practice problems focused on understanding:
- Primitive vs Non-Primitive data types
- Type coercion and conversions
- Loose (`==`) vs strict (`===`) comparisons
- Using `typeof` for type checking
- Real-world use cases involving data validation and operator behavior

---

## âœ… Topics Practiced

### ðŸ”¹ Primitive & Non-Primitive Types
- Declared variables of each primitive type:
  - `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `symbol`
- Declared non-primitive types:
  - `object`, `array`, `function`
- Verified their type using `typeof` and explained mutability

### ðŸ”¹ Type Coercion & Comparison
- Compared values using both `==` and `===` to observe implicit vs strict equality
- Explained special cases like `null == undefined` vs `null === undefined`
- Used arithmetic and logical operators with mixed types to show JS coercion rules

### ðŸ”¹ Type Conversion
- Converted string numbers using `Number()` to ensure numeric operations
- Validated dynamic input using a `validateData()` function
- Demonstrated how JavaScript treats booleans and strings in arithmetic expressions

### ðŸ”¹ Mini Summary Table
- Created a table using `console.table()` to summarize:
- Type, Example, `typeof` result, and mutability

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcome

This session reinforced:
- Clear understanding of JavaScript's flexible type system
- Why type checking is important before applying logic
- How different data types behave under operations
- The importance of choosing the right comparison operator
