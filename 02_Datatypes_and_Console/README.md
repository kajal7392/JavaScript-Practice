# 02 - JavaScript Console, Strict Mode & Data Types

This folder contains practice tasks focused on:
- Using `console` effectively (including `console.table`)
- Understanding `"use strict"` mode
- Working with all JavaScript data types
- Applying `typeof` for type checking
- Real-world object validation logic

---

## âœ… Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Console Features
- `console.table()` used to display structured object/array data in a tabular format

### ðŸ”¹ Strict Mode
- Behavior difference with and without `"use strict"`
- Understanding how undeclared variables are handled in strict mode

### ðŸ”¹ Data Types
Practiced with:
- `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `symbol`
- `object`
- Used `typeof` to inspect each variable

### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Examples
- Created a `userProfile` object and validated:
  - Whether an email is defined and contains `@`
  - Whether age is provided or missing

### ðŸ”¹ Type Conversion Debug
- Demonstrated a common mistake: adding number to string (`"100" + 10`)
- Corrected using `Number()` conversion
